# ActiveCookie
ActiveRecord practice with cookie reward

Hi Pocket Gophers!

If you clone this repo down and run your rake commands to create, migrate, and seed the database, you'll be able to see that some cookies have been made available to you today. You can load the DB to the console with "bundle exec rake console" and get the location and flavors of individual cookies.

You're free to enjoy a cookie, but if you do, please update the database by finding a cookie matching the description of the one you ate and calling #destroy on it so that it's gone from the database. Push your changes and create a pull request.

Enjoy
